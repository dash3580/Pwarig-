# PWARI-G

**Photon Wave Absorption and Reshaping Interpretation with Gravity**  
A deterministic field theory of quantum structure, twist energy, and emergent gravity.

PWARI-G replaces wavefunction collapse and quantization postulates with real-valued soliton fields (ϕ), angular twist buildup (θ), and geometric energy curvature. It reproduces:

- Fine-structure constant α (within 0.02%)
- Atomic energy levels from Z = 1 to 120
- Molecular properties like dipole moments and bond angles
- Redshift–distance relations from supernova data
- Casimir force deviation at large separation

## 🧭 Getting Started

Start with **Volume 1** and read through to **Volume 5**.  
Then explore the molecular PDFs to see how the theory connects to real-world data — all without orbitals, spin assumptions, or wavefunction collapse.

## ✅ Goals

- Derive quantum structure from field dynamics  
- Replace probabilistic QM with deterministic, falsifiable models  
- Match experimental data from atoms, molecules, and cosmology  
- Propose testable predictions: 60.15 nm helium line, Casimir deviation, Bell inequality violation
